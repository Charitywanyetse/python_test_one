# Question 1(i)
# Write a Python program to find the distance between two coordinate points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

# Answer

import math
x1 = 4
x2 = 3
y1 = 2
y2 = 5
distance = math.sqrt(x2*x1)**2 + (y2*y1)**2
#print(f"The distance between two cordinates {x1, y1} and {x2, y2} is {distance}")


# Question 1(ii)
# Write a Python program to find maximum between three numbers.

# Answer 

number_1 = 10
number_2 = 20
number_3 = 5
max = (number_1 + number_2 + number_3)
print(f"Maximum between three numbers is {max}")
